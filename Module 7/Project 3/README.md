# Corner Grocer Item Tracking Program

**Course:** CS 210: Programming Languages  
**Project:** Project Three  
**Language:** C++

## Overview

This program analyzes text records generated by the Corner Grocer to track daily item purchases. It reads a chronological list of purchased items from an input file, calculates the frequency of each item, and allows users to query this data via a menu interface. The goal is to help the store rearrange their produce section based on purchasing trends.

## Features

- **Data Backup:** Automatically generates a `frequency.dat` file backing up accumulated data upon execution.
- **Item Search:** Allows users to input a specific item name to find its purchase frequency.
- **Frequency List:** Displays a complete list of all items and their numerical purchase counts.
- **Histogram:** Displays a visual text-based histogram (using asterisks) to represent purchase frequency.
- **Input Validation:** Handles invalid menu options and user input errors.

## Usage

1.  Ensure `CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt` is in the same directory as the executable.
2.  Run the program.
3.  Use the numbered menu to navigate:
    - **Option 1:** Search for an item.
    - **Option 2:** Print numerical frequency list.
    - **Option 3:** Print histogram.
    - **Option 4:** Exit.

## File Structure

- `src/`: Contains source code files (e.g., `main.cpp`, `Display.cpp`, `Display.hpp`, `Grocery.cpp`, `Grocery.hpp`).
- `input/`: Contains `CS210_Project_Three_Input_File.txt`.
- `docs/`: Design and functionality documentation.
